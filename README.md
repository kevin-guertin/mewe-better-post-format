# MeWe Better Post Format

_A Userstyle for MeWe.com to make your streams show full posts without a "See more" link to expand. Render HTML headers properly (loosely based on Bootstrap). Indents blockquotes and reduces the size of its border._

## [ðŸ“¦ UserCSS file ![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevin-guertin/mewe-better-post-format/master/dist/mewe-better-post-format.user.css)

## Installation

A Userstyle extension is required, I recommend using **_Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)_**.

Then, click on the "ðŸ“¦ UserCSS file" link above, then click "Install style" on the left. I highly recommend enabling checking for updates.

Refresh any MeWe tabs.

### Install This Theme at UserStyles.org

This Userstyle is available on userstyles org [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/181307/), but I highly recommend you to use the UserCSS version here instead.
